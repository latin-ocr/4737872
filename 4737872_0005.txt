This ree! of microfiirn contains materiai v
which has paper color changes, stains, or
illustratione, (some ot which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to

ensure that aii text end illustrations are .
iegibie, exposure settin9s must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text end illustrations exist
in a single· image or when materiei
bacquourtds differ, such tremes may need
to be exposed twice.

Tite first exposure reflects the cernere
operator' s best effert to capture the majority
of the text; the second exposure refiects the

camera operator’s best effert to capture

iliustretive materiai or the remaining text. tt
is hoped that this practice witi result in a
microfiirn product that tuiiy serves the needs
of most reseerchers
